## Submission Instructions

### Overview
For my project I aim to make an app that records data in regards to cycling enthusiasts. The idea came from my father, who is a cyclist himself. He has an excel spreadsheet that he currently uses to record his time, distance and speed on rides, but is frustrated with how it is clunky and how he has to hard code the dates each time a new month rolls around. 
### Features
Sign Up/Sign In - allow users to sign up for the app and use their login credentials to input and access their data.
Data Input - allow users to input their time and distance by date
Data Retrival - returns a table and graph that shows their monthly statistics including an automatically calculated speed.
Gallery Feature - allow users to upload pictures of their rides and view them

### Technologies
Java
Spring Boot
MySQL
Hibernate
Thymeleaf templates
CSS/Bootstrap

### What I'll Have to Learn
How to add upload capabilities to a website
How to calculate weekly totals and only display on "Saturday" of the table
